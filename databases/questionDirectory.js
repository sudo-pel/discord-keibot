The string passes over a small smooth pulley P which is fixed at the top of a cross section of a triangular prism RPG, where angle PRQ = PQR = 30°. The string lies in the vertical plane which contains the pulley and lines of greatest slope of the inclined planes, PR and PQ, as shown in the figure above. When A is held at R with the string taut, B is at P, on the line of greatest slope PQ.\n\nThe point M, lies on PQ such that PM : MQ = 1 : 3.\n\nThe lines of greatest slope of the inclined planes, PR and PM, are smooth but the line of greatest slope MQ is rough.\n\nThe system is released from rest with the string taut, when A is at R and B is at P, on the line of greatest slope PQ. The system initially accelerates but due to the rough section MQ, B comes to rest as it reaches Q.\n\nAssuming that the string remains taut throughout the motion, show that the coefficient of friction between the B and MQ is k√3, where k is a constant to be found (input k as your answer).',
